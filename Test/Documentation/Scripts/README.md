# Test Documentation Scripts

A collection of scripts that help maintaining the test documents up-to-date. It applies the strategy of "Code-as-Documentation". We suggest looking into the following testing concepts to understand the role each artifact plays in the documentation:

- Transitions Tree Testing

## Scripts available

    - `state_machine_generator.py`: generates the State Machine from which the derives later artifacts
